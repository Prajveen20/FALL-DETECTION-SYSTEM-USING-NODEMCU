# FALL-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-NODEMCU
IoT-based fall detection system implemented using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller paired with the MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module. The system monitors acceleration in real time and detects falls using a threshold-based algorithm. Upon detecting a fall, the system sends an instant notification via the Blynk mobile app.


Features
Fall Detection: Monitors acceleration changes to detect potential falls.
Blynk Integration: Sends instant notifications to the Blynk app when a fall is detected.
Customizable Thresholds: Adjustable fall sensitivity for different scenarios.
Compact and Portable: Can be easily implemented in wearable devices.
